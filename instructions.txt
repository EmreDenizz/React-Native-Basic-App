Basic App

- Your goal now is to create an app in 3 steps.

- In the first step you will use Text and TextInput components.
You will connect them in a way that the Text will display whatever is entered into the TextInput.
You can play with input keyboards to see how different platforms respod to them. 

- In the next task, you extend this app adding Clear Button.

- Finally, you will add a Switch that changes the background. Use style to do it. You can apply style programmatically/dynamically.
For example this code will apply random color to the element
this.setState({backgroundColor: randomHex()});

- Steps
  Task 1:
    Takes input from the TextInput
    Displays it in the Text component below
    
  Task 2:
    Add button that clears the content of the field (original said filed?)
    
  Task 3
    Add Switch that will change the background color of your app between white and dark.
    
  Commit each task with a clear description stating task number.
